List of stuff we used:
- Textures: loading and applying ppm textures (floor and blocks)
- Lighting: light source to apply shading to the scene
- alpha blending: for the user interface on the game screen (crosshair and gun loader)
- Non geometric primitaves: for drawing text for the user interface and all of the main screens
- Advanced camera control: used to fly through the scene like you are a space ship
- We tried hardcore to get picking working so if it works count it, otherwise thats 40 above

Please spare our souls. Have mercy upon us, oh almighty Gwosdz!
